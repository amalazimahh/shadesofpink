    <p>Hello there! Welcome to my ePortfolio. In this section, I will be sharing with you little bit of visual on my life.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hobbies and Skillsets</li>
      <p>Although I have a lot of hobbies and they changed every other month, these are some of the hobbies that I still enjoy doing :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Watching Korean dramas where I immerse myself into the fantasy world</li>
        <li>Reading teen-fiction novels</li>
        <li>Go through Pinterest to find inspiration on bedroom makeover, natural make-up look and some Do-It-Yourself ideas.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Vision of my future</li>
      <p>I was so ambitious since I was little- I would dream of being a teacher, Royal Brunei Airline's flight attendant,
      an interior designer, tour guide and unbelieveably, a model. However, as I grow up, I realized that sometimes life will
      not get you to where you expect it to be. And if we are to talk about future, I would honestly say that this is the future.
      My only clear vision of life is to be financially stable, able to support community and my family, no matter what career I would end up doing.
     </p>
      <li>School experience</li>
      <p>Previous schools has been bitter-sweet memories. Not a year in those school period have I ever not break down.
      A little glimpse of my previous high-school, I went to Sekolah Tinggi Perempuan Raja Isteri, one of the three girls high-school in
      Brunei. I took French class during 7th and 8th grade and learning French language is worth it. However, I stopped learning French
      since 9th grade as I already have 8 subjects to focus on for my O Level. Instead, I took Food and Nutrition class where we
      cook both western and eastern cuisine, baking and decorating as well as learn about the nutrients in food. Not just that,
      I also take English Literature class where we learn poems, plays as well as go in depth of Spies by Michael Frayn. </p>
